## 1. Introduction to Python üê£  

**Topics:**  
- Setting up Python Environment (IDE, Jupyter, Anaconda)  
- Python Basics: Syntax, Variables, Data Types, Operators  
- Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)  
- Loops (for, while)  
- Functions and Modules  

**Example Code:**  
```python
# Simple Hello World Program
print("Hello, Python!")
```

---

## 2. Intermediate Python üõ†Ô∏è  

**Topics:**  
- File Handling (Read, Write, Append)  
- Error Handling (try, except, finally)  
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance)  
- Python Libraries (os, sys, logging, etc.)  

**Example Code:**  
```python
# Example: File Handling
with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write("Hello, File Handling!")
```

---

## 3. Advanced Python üöÄ  

**Topics:**  
- Iterators, Generators, and Decorators  
- Regular Expressions (re module)  
- Python Collections (namedtuple, deque, defaultdict)  
- Multithreading and Multiprocessing  
- Memory Management and Garbage Collection  

**Example Code:**  
```python
# Example: Generator
def square_numbers(nums):
    for i in nums:
        yield i * i

gen = square_numbers([1, 2, 3])
print(next(gen))  # Output: 1
```

## 4. Data Science with Python üìä  

**Topics:**  
- Data Analysis with Pandas  
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- NumPy for Numerical Computing  
- Introduction to Statistics and Probability  

**Example Code:**  
```python
import pandas as pd
# Example: Creating a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob'], 'Age': [25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

---

## 5. AI, ML, and DL with Python ü§ñ  

**Topics:**  
- Machine Learning with scikit-learn  
- Neural Networks with TensorFlow and PyTorch  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK and spaCy  
- Computer Vision with OpenCV  

**Example Code:**  
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
# Example: Linear Regression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit([[1], [2], [3]], [2, 4, 6])
print(model.predict([[4]]))  # Output: [8]
```
