# # calculator in pyhton 
# print (4+8*9)

# # floating point division
# print (2/4)
# print (4/2)

# # integer division 
# print (2//4)
# print (4//2)

# # for power we use double ** 
# print (2**3)

# # for power we use 
# print (2**0.5)

# # for roundoff we use round 
# print (round (2**0.5, 3))

# variables 

# number1 = 6
# print (number1)

# we can store any type of number in variables   
# It is dynamic programming language which means data is chngeable 

# number1 = 6
# print (number1)


# name = "Hassan"
# print (name)

# name = 1234
# print (name)

# we don't have to write data type in python

# variable rules
# you cannot start vraible with number but you can with letter or _ underscore but can use numbers in between 
# we cannot use special symbols in start or in between in variable decleration 
# 

# conventions

# user_one_name = "Ali Raza" # snake case writing 
# userOneName = "Ali Raza" # camel case writing 


# CHAPTER 2

# # Strings

# first_name = "Muhammad "
# Last_name = "Hassan"
# full_name = first_name + Last_name

# print (full_name) 

# # we cannot add string with number but by adding inverted commas we can add numbers with string 

# print (first_name + "3")

# # we cannot add number with string but 
# # we can use multiply with string 

# print (Last_name * 6)

# user input
# user function 

# input function always take input as an string 

# name = input ("type your name")
# print("Hello "+ name )

# age = input("type your age")
# print ("Your age is "+ "20")

# int function 
# int ()  becsuse python take every single chracter as an string so we have to use integer function 

name, rollno=input("type your name and rollno")
